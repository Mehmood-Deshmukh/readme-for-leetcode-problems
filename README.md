# LeetCode ReadMe Generator

## What's This?
Hello! I recently started documenting my LeetCode solutions, and it's **painful** in my opinion to keep track of all the problems and solutions. Copy pasting questions, adjusting formatting, and organizing content is very tedious and time-consuming.

So, I decided to take the lazy route and built this **website** that **automatically fetches questions from LeetCode** and generates a neat, ready-to-use README file.

I often forget how did I solve a problem, so i keep visiting my own repository to see the solution and having a README file with the problem statement and solution is much more convenient. This is something I made for myself, but I thought it might be useful for others too. 

## How to Use 
1. Enter the **title** of the LeetCode question: Search for the question on searchbar and select the question.
2. Wait for results to load.
3. Download or copy the README.
