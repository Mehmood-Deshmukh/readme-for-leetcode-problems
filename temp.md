You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.<br /><br />Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.<br /><br />Return *the maximum amount of water a container can store*.<br /><br />**Notice** that you may not slant the container.<br /><br />**Example 1:**<br /><br />![Image](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg)<br /><br />**Input:** height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]<br />**Output:** 49<br />**Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.<br /><br />**Example 2:**<br /><br />**Input:** height = [1,1]<br />**Output:** 1<br /><br />**Constraints:**<br /><br />*   `n == height.length`<br />*   `2 <= n <= 105`<br />*   `0 <= height[i] <= 104`
